A SVG recolouration demo, showing the power of vector graphics.

What is it?
===========
SVG is an XMl-based vector graphics language. This makes it easy for us
to manipulate attributes such as individual colours and lines within the
graphic.

This demo manipulates a SVG using a particular colour map in order to
create many colour variations of the same sprite. Furthermore, the demo
manages a filter over the overall colours in order to create night and
day variations.

The future
==========
This demo uses string replacement to change colours in an image which is
fast but has limitations in terms of functionality.

In the future I may implement an XML parsing version in order to
introduce advanced functionality such as manipulating attributes and
creating lighting effects.
