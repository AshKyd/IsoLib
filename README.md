A SVG recolouration demo, showing the power of vector graphics.

## What is it?

SVG is an XML-based vector graphics language. This makes it easy for us
to manipulate attributes such as individual colours and lines within the
graphic.

This demo manipulates a SVG using a particular colour map in order to
create many colour variations of the same sprite. Furthermore, the demo
manages a filter over the overall colours in order to create night and
day variations.

## The Code

To illustrate my point, you can create a variation with the following
code:

    const svg = paint(svg, {
    	primary : '#ff0000',
    	secondary : '#0000ff',
    	time : 13
    });

This demo recolours one of the image templates to be a primarily red
sprite with blue highlight colours as it would appear at 1 PM.

You can then add the SVG to the DOM the following code, for instance:

    $('body').append(svg);

# The future

This demo uses string replacement to change colours in an image which is
fast but has limitations in terms of functionality.

In the future I may implement an XML parsing version in order to
introduce advanced functionality such as manipulating attributes and
creating lighting effects.
